# Hi there, I'm Jasmine! 👋
As an aspiring security engineer, my work is centered around data justice and human-centered design to strive for solutions that are inclusive.

## About
I'm an Informatics student at the University of Washington with a focus in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance graduating in June 2026. Before getting into Informatics at UW, I spent years in retail and logistics which are roles that taught me how to interact with people and systems under pressure. I am a firm believer that security should empower people, not exclude them. Through my work I aim to create a digital world where safety is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

## Projects

### UW Capstone: SilverGuard (Ongoing)
Role: Product Manager
- Leading a cross-functional team to develop a cybersecurity and fraud prevention tool that is designed for seniors (65 years and older) which is a population that is overlooked in traditional security models.
- Responsible for defining product vision, roadmap, and the core features based on field research into social engineering patterns and online vulnerability.

### Securing the AI Workflow: A Practical Analysis of Attack Vectors and Mitigations in the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Role: Security Researcher
- Analyzed security architecture of Model Context Protocol (MCP) to identify its reliance on implicit trust creates new remote code execution attack surfaces for AI agents. 
- Created a comprehensive threat model of MCP architecture by identifying vulnerabilies in the data exchange between hosts (LLMs) and servers (local resources).
- Recreated common attack vectors such as tool shadowing and command injection using FastMCP and Python.

### Campus Reservation & Scheduling Platform (CRISP)
Role: UX Researcher
- Created a centralized platform designed to solve fragmentation of the University of Washington's room reservation ecosystem which led to operational inefficiencies.
- Spearheaded the empirical investigation by conducting surveys with 8+ student leaders and RSO officers to identify friction points in the event lifecycle.
- Applied value sensitive design principles to ensure the platform balanced autonomy of RSO leaders with the accountability and oversight required by administrative staff.
