# Hi there, I'm Jasmine! 👋
As an aspiring security engineer, my work is centered around data justice and human-centered design to strive for solutions that are inclusive.

### About
I'm an Informatics student at the University of Washington with a focus in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, graduating in June 2026. Before UW, I spent years in retail and logistics which are roles that taught me how to interact with people and systems under pressure. Through my work I aim to create a digital world where safety is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

### Projects

#### UW Capstone: SilverGuard (Ongoing)
- As the Product Manager, I am leading a cross-functional team to develop a cybersecurity and fraud prevention tool that is designed for seniors (65 years and older) which is a population that is overlooked in traditional security models.
- Responsible for defining product vision, roadmap, and the core features based on field research into social engineering patterns and online vulnerability.

#### Securing the AI Workflow: A Practical Analysis of Attack Vectors and Mitigations in the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- As a Security Researcher, I analyzed security architecture of Model Context Protocol (MCP) to identify its reliance on implicit trust creates new remote code execution attack surfaces for AI agents. 
- Created a comprehensive threat model of MCP architecture by identifying vulnerabilies in the data exchange between hosts (LLMs) and servers (local resources).
- Recreated common attack vectors such as tool shadowing and command injection using FastMCP and Python.

#### UW HusKey Manager
- As an Application Security Engineer, I performed application security testing on a Dockerized PHP password manager using OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities in authentication and access control.
- Remediated SQL injection vulnerabilities using parameterized queries and strengthened input/output handling to mitigate XSS.
- Hardened infrastructure by deploying CA-signed TLS certificates in a Dockerized Nginx environment and integrated Loggly for centralized security monitoring.
